### Characteristics of tsibble objects

-   Essentially a tsibble is a time series table with time being the
    index i.e temporal structure. The year column is the index is this
    dataset.

-   Has a frequency, in this case, it is annual (IY).

-   Has key column(s). In this case, the country column is the key
    column and helps us identify the time series uniquely. Keys are
    unique identifiers.

-   Has measured variables. For each key, we have measured variable(s).

### The tourism dataset

A dataset containing the quarterly overnight trips from 1998 Q1 to 2016
Q4 across Australia.

``` r
data("tourism")

head(tourism)
```

| Quarter | Region   | State           | Purpose  |    Trips |
|:--------|:---------|:----------------|:---------|---------:|
| 1998 Q1 | Adelaide | South Australia | Business | 135.0777 |
| 1998 Q2 | Adelaide | South Australia | Business | 109.9873 |
| 1998 Q3 | Adelaide | South Australia | Business | 166.0347 |
| 1998 Q4 | Adelaide | South Australia | Business | 127.1605 |
| 1999 Q1 | Adelaide | South Australia | Business | 137.4485 |
| 1999 Q2 | Adelaide | South Australia | Business | 199.9126 |

Also a tsibble object with the Quarter column being the index, Region,
State, and Purpose being the keys, and Trips being the measured
variable. The data is in quarterly frequency.

### Constructing a tsibble

``` r
data <- tsibble(
  year = 2017:2022,
  cost = c(100, 393, 192, 394, 400, 500),
  index = year
)

data
```

| year | cost |
|-----:|-----:|
| 2017 |  100 |
| 2018 |  393 |
| 2019 |  192 |
| 2020 |  394 |
| 2021 |  400 |
| 2022 |  500 |

### Convert a tibble to a tsibble

``` r
data <- tibble(
  year = 2017:2022,
  cost = c(100, 393, 192, 394, 400, 500)
  ) %>% 
  as_tsibble(index = year)

data
```

| year | cost |
|-----:|-----:|
| 2017 |  100 |
| 2018 |  393 |
| 2019 |  192 |
| 2020 |  394 |
| 2021 |  400 |
| 2022 |  500 |

``` r
mobile <- read_csv("datasets/mobile_money_data.csv", show_col_types = F)

mobile %>% 
  select(start_time, 3:5) %>% 
  mutate(start_time = mdy_hms(start_time),
         year_quartet = wday(start_time)) %>% 
  head()
```

# Austrarian Pharmaceutical Benefits datasets

  filter(atc2 == "A10") %>%

There is a very clear and increasing trend over time and very strong
seasonality.

We can see that seasonality goes up as the level of the series goes up.

There are some significant drops at the start of each, which could be
caused by the government subsidization scheme.

# Lab session 1

``` r
# download dataset and convert to tsibble object
my_tourism <- rio::import(file = "http://robjhyndman.com/data/tourism.xlsx")%>%
  mutate(Quarter = yearquarter(Quarter)) %>%
  as_tsibble(
    index = Quarter,
    key = c(Region, State, Purpose)
  )

# Find what combination of Region and Purpose had the maximum number of
# overnight trips on average.
my_tourism %>%
  group_by(Region, Purpose) %>%
  summarise(Trips = mean(Trips)) %>%
  ungroup() %>%

### Passengers dataset

Passenger numbers on Ansett airline flights

-   Description

The data features a major pilotsâ€™ industrial dispute which results in
some weeks having zero passengers. There were also at least two changes
in the definitions of passenger classes.

``` r
data("ansett")

head(ansett)
```

| Week     | Airports | Class    | Passengers |
|:---------|:---------|:---------|-----------:|
