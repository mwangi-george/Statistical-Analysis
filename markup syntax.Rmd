On line 17, change the font-family of all the text in your report (including headers, except R code chunks) to "Bookman", serif.
On line 21, change the color of the body text to a slight grey (#333333).
On line 24, change the color of all links to red.
On line 27, reduce the font of the R code elements, which are wrapped in pre HTML tags, to 10px

## Summary 

The **International Labour Organization (ILO)** has many [data sets](http://www.ilo.org/global/statistics-and-databases/lang--en/index.htm) on working conditions. For example, one can look at how weekly working hours have been decreasing in many countries of the world, while monetary compensation has risen. In this report, *the reduction in weekly working hours* in European countries is analysed, and a comparison between 1996 and 2006 is made. All analysed countries have seen a decrease in weekly working hours since 1996 – some more than others.

## Preparations 

This is where you have to load the necessary R packages.

## Analysis

### Data

The herein used data can be found in the [statistics database of the ILO](http://www.ilo.org/ilostat/faces/wcnav_defaultSelection;ILOSTATCOOKIE=ZOm2Lqrr-OIuzxNGn2_08bNe9AmHQ1kUA6FydqyZJeIudFLb2Yz5!1845546174?_afrLoop=32158017365146&_afrWindowMode=0&_afrWindowId=null#!%40%40%3F_afrWindowId%3Dnull%26_afrLoop%3D32158017365146%26_afrWindowMode%3D0%26_adf.ctrl-state%3D4cwaylvi8_4). For the purpose of this course, it has been slightly preprocessed.

```{r}
load(url("http://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.datacamp.com/production/course_5807/datasets/ilo_data.RData"))
```

```{r}
# Some summary statistics
ilo_data %>%
  group_by(year) %>%
  summarize(mean_hourly_compensation = mean(hourly_compensation),
            mean_working_hours = mean(working_hours))
```

As can be seen from the above table, the average weekly working hours of European countries have been descreasing since 1980.

### Preprocessing

The data is now filtered so it only contains the years 1996 and 2006 – a good time range for comparison. 

```{r}
ilo_data <- ilo_data %>%
  filter(year == "1996" | year == "2006")
  
# Reorder country factor levels
ilo_data <- ilo_data %>%
  # Arrange data frame first, so last is always 2006
  arrange(year) %>%
  # Use the fct_reorder function inside mutate to reorder countries by working hours in 2006
  mutate(country = fct_reorder(country,
                               working_hours,
                               last))
```  

### Results

In the following, a plot that shows the reduction of weekly working hours from 1996 to 2006 in each country is produced.

First, a custom theme is defined.

```{r}
# Better to define your own function than to always type the same stuff
theme_ilo <- function(){
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(
    text = element_text(family = "Bookman", color = "gray25"),
    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 12),
    plot.caption = element_text(color = "gray30"),
    plot.background = element_rect(fill = "gray95"),
    plot.margin = unit(c(5, 10, 5, 10), units = "mm")
  )
}
```  

Then, the plot is produced. 

```{r}
# Compute temporary data set for optimal label placement
median_working_hours <- ilo_data %>%
  group_by(country) %>%
  summarize(median_working_hours_per_country = median(working_hours)) %>%
  ungroup()

# Have a look at the structure of this data set
str(median_working_hours)

# Plot
ggplot(ilo_data) +
  geom_path(aes(x = working_hours, y = country),
            arrow = arrow(length = unit(1.5, "mm"), type = "closed")) +
  # Add labels for values (both 1996 and 2006)
  geom_text(
        aes(x = working_hours,
            y = country,
            label = round(working_hours, 1),
            hjust = ifelse(year == "2006", 1.4, -0.4)
          ),
        # Change the appearance of the text
        size = 3,
        family = "Bookman",
        color = "gray25"
   ) +
  # Add labels for country
  geom_text(data = median_working_hours,
            aes(y = country,
                x = median_working_hours_per_country,
                label = country),
            vjust = 2,
            family = "Bookman",
            color = "gray25") +
  # Add titles
  labs(
    title = "People work less in 2006 compared to 1996",
    subtitle = "Working hours in European countries, development since 1996",
    caption = "Data source: ILO, 2017"
  ) +
  # Apply your theme 
  theme_ilo() +
  # Remove axes and grids
  theme(
    axis.ticks = element_blank(),
    axis.title = element_blank(),
    axis.text = element_blank(),
    panel.grid = element_blank(),
    # Also, let's reduce the font size of the subtitle
    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 9)
  ) +
  # Reset coordinate system
  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(25, 41))
```
