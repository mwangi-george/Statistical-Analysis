Guys, someone bail me out here.
I cant figure out the proble, I have those two attributes on my dataset.
12/4/22, 17:39 - +254 797 817059: Reread the error.
KeyError always tells you a column name isn't available.
Also it'll show you the columns, in your case ```Xtrain``` doesn't have ```humidity``` and ```windspeed``` columns. So recheck your DataFrame columns so as to select the ones you need
12/4/22, 17:40 - +254 712 467004: <Media omitted>
I have put them.


I had dooen this before.
So, I think this is where the rain started beating me.
12/4/22, 17:42 - +254 797 817059: You're selecting them from ```Xtrain``` DataFrame, so check the DataFrame to confirm if they're there

The solution that you're looking for is ```[0:-1]```, this way you'll select all columns except -1 which is the last column is exclusive in X.

There're other ways you can select columns. Go through the documentation.


Another way is to drop the columns you don't need üôÇ

rather than clutter the ```train_test_split``` with the column indices

12/9/22, 22:01 - +254 723 727870: You've blown up the LAMBCHOP doomsday device and relieved the bunnies of their work duries -- and now you need to escape from the space station as quickly and as orderly as possible! The bunnies have all gathered in various locations throughout the station, and need to make their way towards the seemingly endless amount of escape pods positioned in other parts of the station. You need to get the numerous bunnies through the various rooms to the escape pods. Unfortunately, the corridors between the rooms can only fit so many bunnies at a time. What's more, many of the corridors were resized to accommodate the LAMBCHOP, so they vary in how many bunnies can move through them at a time. 

Given the starting room numbers of the groups of bunnies, the room numbers of the escape pods, and how many bunnies can fit through at a time in each direction of every corridor in between, figure out how many bunnies can safely make it to the escape pods at a time at peak.

Write a function solution(entrances, exits, path) that takes an array of integers denoting where the groups of gathered bunnies are, an array of integers denoting where the escape pods are located, and an array of an array of integers of the corridors, returning the total number of bunnies that can get through at each time step as an int. The entrances and exits are disjoint and thus will never overlap. The path element path[A][B] = C describes that the corridor going from A to B can fit C bunnies at each time step.  There are at most 50 rooms connected by the corridors and at most 2000000 bunnies that will fit at a time.

For example, if you have:
entrances = [0, 1]
exits = [4, 5]
path = [
  [0, 0, 4, 6, 0, 0],  # Room 0: Bunnies
  [0, 0, 5, 2, 0, 0],  # Room 1: Bunnies
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 4, 4],  # Room 2: Intermediate room
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 6, 6],  # Room 3: Intermediate room
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],  # Room 4: Escape pods
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],  # Room 5: Escape pods
]

Then in each time step, the following might happen:
0 sends 4/4 bunnies to 2 and 6/6 bunnies to 3
1 sends 4/5 bunnies to 2 and 2/2 bunnies to 3
2 sends 4/4 bunnies to 4 and 4/4 bunnies to 5
3 sends 4/6 bunnies to 4 and 4/6 bunnies to 5

So, in total, 16 bunnies could make it to the escape pods at 4 and 5 at each time step.  (Note that in this example, room 3 could have sent any variation of 8 bunnies to 4 and 5, such as 2/6 and 6/6, but the final solution remains the same.)

CSS guys in the house
12/31/22, 18:12 - +254 111356555: The problem is when you need to output a two dimensional  layout. Just learn both they ain't hard to understand
12/31/22, 18:12 - +254 757 446077: Grid simplifies the process. Especially if you want to implement complex layouts.
12/31/22, 18:12 - +254 796 161357: Cool
12/31/22, 18:13 - +254 796 161357: I'll add grid to my resolutions üòÖ
12/31/22, 18:14 - +254 111356555: Lately I have been addicted to software development. That's how I have been learning languages like react js, node, mysql, css and html. Quite interesting.

12/31/22, 18:16 - +254 757 446077: A 30 mins tutorial and 3 hrs practice and you'll be good.
12/31/22, 18:17 - +254 757 446077: That's great. There's so much joy in learning, building software products and growing. What's your current strength?

12/31/22, 18:18 - +254 796 161357: Niceüí™üèΩ
12/31/22, 18:19 - +254 713 928192: I think you should it's easier creating two dimensional layout with grid
12/31/22, 18:20 - +254 111356555: Data Science is my strong area.

I'm However equally strong in full stack dev but using javascript (more so react js for my frontend,  node js+express js and mysql for backend).. I'm all round
12/31/22, 18:22 - +254 111356555: True. Flex will only be good for one dimension layouts.
You can however set your Flex to 50% to create yourself a split. That way you can utilise 50% of your screen for one thing and the other 50% for another thing (float).

1/16/23, 12:42 - +254 706 823165: Any assistance
1/16/23, 12:42 - +254 111356555: It's a fresh app? Without any changes? Azin an npx create react app?
1/16/23, 12:43 - +254 707 313868: No I had created some components so it was working before until it wasn't
1/16/23, 12:45 - +254 111356555: Check the last component you rendered in your routes.
1/16/23, 12:45 - +254 111356555: User Id you mean?
1/16/23, 12:45 - +254 706 823165: Username
1/16/23, 12:47 - +254 111356555: Have you tried using JSON Web tokens?
1/16/23, 12:51 - +254 706 823165: This is purely about Django models
1/16/23, 12:52 - +254 706 823165: This is frontend but am on backand
1/16/23, 12:52 - +254 111356555: I'm not a django guru but these technologies work similarly.

Inspect the app and go to application, on local storage check whether you have a key and a value.
If yes, use the local storage to get the item you want, in this case the username.
1/16/23, 12:53 - +254 111356555: It doesn't matter. 
Check the documentation of JWT in Django.
1/16/23, 12:53 - +254 707 313868: Well Thankyou, I've deleted the last component I created and it's working
1/16/23, 12:54 - +254 111356555: You can recreate the component and check on how you are rendering the component. 

And you are welcome
1/16/23, 12:59 - +254 111356555: Authentication happens in the backend. Verify your tokens from the backend

1/28/23, 22:20 - +254 112788037: Look at the associates of Crypto like NFL and other crypto based instruments

1/28/23, 22:23 - +254 112788037: Crypto was a decentralized type of payment but when they introduced it to futures market all things changed.
1/28/23, 22:24 - +254 752 544284: Doge is a meme coin. People who don't follow the tech are usually swayed by influencers like Elon
1/28/23, 22:24 - +254 112788037: Its called "TRUST NO ONE" check it in Netflix. Its not a conspiracy theory but rather a reality revealed on how most these crypto owners are operating

There is this intro part on how to interact with the community in the social media channels provided by the admins.

One thing that has stuck with me is providing as much information as possible in your request, question,problem or explanation...

Not limited to code snippets, error messages and everything you've tried and where you are now.

For example rather than asking ,who knows how to use power BI?

Post: I need someone who knows how to use power BI on an intermediate level to assist me in a project or pick up a project. The data has already been cleaned. Pay is ***** or there is no pay with offer to add the project to your portfolio. Delivery in 1 week. Dm me for more info.

The benefits of such cannot be understated. Other than not getting 10's of DMs and escaping the back and forth of answering the same question to 10's of people,you will get 3 quality responses. plus it's good for the tech culture.

Not a must you go this way but it's something I adopted in my tech journey ,found it useful and thought it's good to spread it......

Ola üëãThe Game of Learners season 4 applications is on ...

The Game of Learners (GOL) Season is a 5-week virtual hackathon designed to give students the platform to learn quickly and showcase their ability to solve a real-world problem as a team. 

While the competition itself is only 5 weeks, the entire Season 4 event will span from 1st February to 14th April 2023, encompassing the GOL Draft, pre-season training, competition, judging, and finale.

https://0xdvvid.hashnode.dev/from-python-to-golang
2/27/23, 10:05 - +254 793 601115: benchmark with fastapi
2/27/23, 10:07 - +256 755 826939: Will try it out. FastAPI has great asynchronous requests. It's light weight and when combined with unicorn, its pretty decent. 

I use it on serverless instances sometimes üòä
2/27/23, 10:09 - +254 793 601115: lambda?
2/27/23, 10:11 - +256 755 826939: Yeah. But I recommend vercel or onrender 

AWS lambda can be a nightmare to use with docker
2/27/23, 10:17 - +254 793 601115: they provide a similar service to lambda functions ?
2/27/23, 10:21 - +256 755 826939: Yes. One is just alot simpler to work with than the other.
2/27/23, 10:39 - +254 793 601115: ebu send me a link ill appreciate
2/27/23, 10:40 - +254 793 601115: im to implement a couple of micro services on lambda it'll be good to get alternatives 

plus link to a tutorial also
2/27/23, 10:42 - +256 755 826939: https://vercel.com
Its exactly like using Heroku in a way. And after login in with CLI, you just add a single file called vercel.JSON to your project root and it will instantly turn it into a cloud function. Just make sure to crosscheck the app entry point and requirements files in your package.JSON or requirements.txt depending on the language you are using

The firm stated in its API announcement blog, "commercializing the technology helps us pay for our ongoing AI research, safety, and policy efforts." The second reason is a stated bias toward helping large companies. It is "hard for anyone except larger companies to benefit from the underlying technology," OpenAI stated. Finally, the company claims it is safer to release via an API instead of open-source because the firm can respond to cases of misuse." https://bit.ly/3Tlzi5q
